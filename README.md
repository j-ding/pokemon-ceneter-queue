### Method 2: Manual File Creation

2. Create the following files in that folder:
   - `manifest.json`
   - `background.js`
   - `content.js`
   - `popup.html`
   - `popup.js`
3. Copy the code from each file in this repository

5. Follow steps 2-3 from Method 1 above

## File Structure üìÅ

```
pokemon-queue-monitor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json       # Extension configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js       # Service worker for monitoring network requests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js         # Content script injected into Pokemon Center pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html         # Extension popup UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js           # Popup functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon16.png         # Toolbar icon (16x16)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon48.png         # Extension icon (48x48)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icon128.png        # Store icon (128x128)
```

## Usage üìñ

1. **Navigate to Pokemon Center**: Go to [pokemoncenter.com](https://www.pokemoncenter.com)
2. **Enter Queue**: When the site is busy, you'll be placed in a virtual queue
3. **Monitor Position**: Your position will automatically appear as a badge on the extension icon
4. **Check Details**: Click the extension icon to see detailed information
5. **Wait**: The extension will update automatically as your position improves
6. **Shop**: When you reach position 0, the badge will turn green and you can access the store!

## How It Works üîß

The extension monitors network responses from Pokemon Center's Incapsula/Imperva queue system. When it detects queue data in the format:

```json
{
  "pos": 23082,
  "pending": 1,
  "ttw": 8,
  "rld": 0
}
```

It extracts and displays:
- `pos`: Your position in line
- `pending`: Queue status (1 = in queue)
- `ttw`: Estimated time to wait (in minutes)

## Icons üé®

You'll need to provide Pokeball icon images in three sizes:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extensions page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)
